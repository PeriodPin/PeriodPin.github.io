Period Pin is a social enterprise dedicated to helping Canadians find free menstrual products near them. Menstruators can visit our website, where they'll see a map of their area with the nearest locations for free period products. These might be public washrooms, community centers, or businesses that have all agreed to appear on the map.

Our team at Period Pin consists of Karen the menstrual expert, a soon-to-be published author and researcher on sustainable menstruation; and Patrick the tech expert, with experience in data science and visualizations. Together, we bring the skills and passion needed to make Period Pin a success.
